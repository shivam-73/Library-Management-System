This project involves building a simple library management system in C++. This system 
would allow the librarian to manage books and keep track of issued books. The librarian 
should be able to add new books, search for books, issue a book, and return a book. 
The project will provide students an opportunity to apply knowledge of various data structures 
such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and more in a practical scenario. It will also involve 
implementing essential algorithms for searching and sorting. 
Features: 
Add New Books: 
The librarian should be able to add new books to the system. Each book has a unique ID, title, 
author, and status (available or issued). 
Use an array or linked list to store book data 
Search for a Book: 
The librarian should be able to search for a book by its title or ID. If the book is found, display 
its details. 
Implement a search algorithm (like binary search if the list of books is sorted, or a simple 
linear search) to find a book. 
Issue a Book: 
When a book is issued, change its status from available to issued and store the details of the 
student to whom the book has been issued. 
Consider using a stack or queue structure to manage book issues. 
Return a Book: 
When a book is returned, change its status from issued to available and remove the details of 
the student to whom the book had been issued.
List All Books: 
The librarian should be able to view a list of all books in the library. 
Implement a sorting algorithm (like quick sort or merge sort) to display the books in a sorted 
manner (by ID or title). 
Delete a Book: 
The librarian should be able to delete a book from the system. 
If you're using a linked list to store books, this will involve removing a node from the list.
